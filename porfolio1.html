            The lorem ipsum is a placeholder text used in publishing and graphic design. 
            This filler text is a short paragraph that contains all the letters of the alphabet. 
            The lorem ipsum is based on De finibus bonorum et malorum, a Latin text written by Cicero in 45 BC. Typographers and printers have used passages from this work for formatting since the 16th century. Many words have been added or modified over the centuries. As a result, the lorem ipsum is no longer considered Latin, even though it looks a lot like it.
            The lorem ipsum gets its name from the Latin phrase Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet. which translates to “Nor is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain.”
